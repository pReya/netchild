        <h2><strong>ðŸ’» Developer</strong><br />All them stacks</h2>
        <p>I built my first website when I was around 13. Since then I've been constantly dabbling with code. In 2019, I got my Bachelor's degree in Technical Computer Science (Technische Informatik) at <a href="https://www.haw-hamburg.de/">HAW Hamburg</a> and I've been working as a software developer since then. Currently I mostly build frontend applications using React at my employer <a href="https://www.elbstack.com/">Elbstack</a>.</p>

        <h2><strong>ðŸ“£ Communicator</strong><br />Writing and talking about technology</h2>
        <p>Before I became a software developer, I worked as a tech writer for many years. What started as a nerdy hobby when I was a teenager turned into a proper career: I've written well over 1500 pieces on technology topics and got a proper job training as an editor (Volontariat). I've visited trade shows and press conferences all over the world and spent a year living and working in Silicon Valley as a correspondent for <a href="https://www.t3n.de/">t3n Magazin</a>. Sometimes I still write as a freelancer for various publications. Recently I'm also trying to work as a speaker and teacher on technology and code topics.</p>

        <h2><strong>ðŸ›  Maker</strong><br />Building stuff and helping others build</h2>
        <p>I like building â€“ both electrical, nerdy, internet-of-things stuff but also non-technical and simple things from wood and metal, like furniture. Building thins is more fun if you don't do it alone â€“ that's why I'm spending most of my free time helping to establish <a href="https://www.welcome-werkstatt.de/">Welcome Werkstatt e. V.</a> â€“ a club for likeminded people, who maintain an open works- and makerspace in Hamburg Barmbek.</p>
